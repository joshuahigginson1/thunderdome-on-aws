âš  WARNING: Deletion protection is currently set to 'false'.

This configuration allows for the easy deletion and clean up of Thunderdome, which may be
suitable for development or testing environments. For deploying Thunderdome to production,
it is strongly recommended to enable deletion protection, by setting this variable to 'true'.

This will prevent accidental deletions of key resources such as the Thunderdome PostGres database.

Please review and adjust this setting as needed for your specific use case.
